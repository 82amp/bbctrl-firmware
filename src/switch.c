/* Switch Modes
 *
 *    The switches are considered to be homing switches when machine_state is
 *    MACHINE_HOMING. At all other times they are treated as limit switches:
 *      - Hitting a homing switch puts the current move into feedhold
 *      - Hitting a limit switch causes the machine to shut down and go into lockdown until reset
 *
 *     The normally open switch modes (NO) trigger an interrupt on the falling edge
 *    and lockout subsequent interrupts for the defined lockout period. This approach
 *    beats doing debouncing as an integration as switches fire immediately.
 *
 *     The normally closed switch modes (NC) trigger an interrupt on the rising edge
 *    and lockout subsequent interrupts for the defined lockout period. Ditto on the method.
