/* Planner Notes
 *
 * The planner works below the machine and above the
 * motor mapping and stepper execution layers. A rudimentary
 * multitasking capability is implemented for long-running commands
 * such as lines, arcs, and dwells.  These functions are coded as
 * non-blocking continuations - which are simple state machines
 * that are re-entered multiple times until a particular operation
 * is complete. These functions have 2 parts - the initial call,
 * which sets up the local context, and callbacks (continuations)
 * that are called from the main loop.
 *
 * One important concept is isolation of the three layers of the
 * data model - the Gcode model (gm), planner model (bf queue & mm),
 * and runtime model (exec.c).
 *
 * The Gcode model is owned by the machine and should only be
 * accessed by mach_xxxx() functions. Data from the Gcode model is
 * transferred to the planner by the mp_xxx() functions called by
 * the machine.
 *
 * The planner should only use data in the planner model. When a
 * move (block) is ready for execution the planner data is
 * transferred to the runtime model, which should also be isolated.
 *
 * Lower-level models should never use data from upper-level models
 * as the data may have changed and lead to unpredictable results.

/*** Calculate move acceleration / deceleration
 *
 * This rather brute-force and long-ish function sets section lengths and
 * velocities based on the line length and velocities requested.  It modifies
 * the incoming bf buffer and returns accurate head, body and tail lengths, and
 * accurate or reasonably approximate velocities.  We care about accuracy on
 * lengths, less so for velocity, as long as velocity errs on the side of too
 * slow.
 *
 * Note: We need the velocities to be set even for zero-length sections (Note:
 * sections, not moves) so we can compute entry and exits for adjacent sections.
 *
 * Inputs used are:
 *
 *   bf->length            - actual block length, length is never changed
 *   bf->entry_velocity    - requested Ve, entry velocity is never changed
 *   bf->cruise_velocity   - requested Vt, is often changed
 *   bf->exit_velocity     - requested Vx, may change for degenerate cases
 *   bf->cruise_vmax       - used in some comparisons
 *   bf->delta_vmax        - used to degrade velocity of short blocks
 *
 * Variables that may be set/updated are:
 *
 *   bf->entry_velocity    - requested Ve
 *   bf->cruise_velocity   - requested Vt
 *   bf->exit_velocity     - requested Vx
 *   bf->head_length       - bf->length allocated to head
 *   bf->body_length       - bf->length allocated to body
 *   bf->tail_length       - bf->length allocated to tail
 *
 * Note: The following conditions must be met on entry:
 *
 *     bf->length must be non-zero (filter these out upstream)
 *     bf->entry_velocity <= bf->cruise_velocity >= bf->exit_velocity
 *
 * Classes of moves:
 *
 *   Requested-Fit - The move has sufficient length to achieve the target
 *     velocity (cruise velocity).  I.e it will accommodate the acceleration /
 *     deceleration profile in the given length.
 *
 *   Rate-Limited-Fit - The move does not have sufficient length to achieve
 *     target velocity.  In this case the cruise velocity will be set lower than
 *     the requested velocity (incoming bf->cruise_velocity).  The entry and
 *     exit velocities are satisfied.
 *
 *   Degraded-Fit - The move does not have sufficient length to transition from
 *     the entry velocity to the exit velocity in the available length. These
 *     velocities are not negotiable, so a degraded solution is found.
 *
 *     In worst cases, the move cannot be executed as the required execution
 *     time is less than the minimum segment time.  The first degradation is to
 *     reduce the move to a body-only segment with an average velocity.  If that
 *     still doesn't fit then the move velocity is reduced so it fits into a
 *     minimum segment.  This will reduce the velocities in that region of the
 *     planner buffer as the moves are replanned to that worst-case move.
 *
 * Various cases handled (H=head, B=body, T=tail)
 *
 *   Requested-Fit cases:
 *
 *       HBT  Ve<Vt>Vx    sufficient length exists for all parts (corner
 *                        case: HBT')
 *       HB   Ve<Vt=Vx    head accelerates to cruise - exits at full speed
 *                        (corner case: H')
 *       BT   Ve=Vt>Vx    enter at full speed & decelerate (corner case: T')
 *       HT   Ve & Vx     perfect fit HT (very rare). May be symmetric or
 *                        asymmetric
 *       H    Ve<Vx       perfect fit H (common, results from planning)
 *       T    Ve>Vx       perfect fit T (common, results from planning)
 *       B    Ve=Vt=Vx    Velocities are close to each other and within
 *                        matching tolerance
 *
 *   Rate-Limited cases - Ve and Vx can be satisfied but Vt cannot:
 *
 *       HT    (Ve=Vx)<Vt    symmetric case. Split the length and compute Vt.
 *       HT'   (Ve!=Vx)<Vt   asymmetric case. Find H and T by successive
 *                           approximation.
 *       HBT'  body length < min body length - treated as an HT case
 *       H'    body length < min body length - subsume body into head length
 *       T'    body length < min body length - subsume body into tail length
 *
 *   Degraded fit cases - line is too short to satisfy both Ve and Vx:
 *
 *       H"    Ve<Vx        Ve is degraded (velocity step). Vx is met
 *       T"    Ve>Vx        Ve is degraded (velocity step). Vx is met
 *       B"    <short>      line is very short but drawable; is treated as a
 *                          body only
 *       F     <too short>  force fit: This block is slowed down until it can
 *                          be executed
 *
 * Note: The order of the cases/tests in the code is important.  Start with
 * the shortest cases first and work up. Not only does this simplify the order
 * of the tests, but it reduces execution time when you need it most - when
 * tons of pathologically short Gcode blocks are being thrown at you.

/*** Plans the entire queue
 *
 * The block list is the circular buffer of planner buffers (bl's). The block
 * currently being planned is the "bl" block.  The "first block" is the next
 * block to execute; queued immediately behind the currently executing block,
 * aka the "running" block.  In some cases, there is no first block because the
 * list is empty or there is only one block and it is already running.
 *
 * If blocks following the first block are already optimally planned (non
 * replannable) the first block that is not optimally planned becomes the
 * effective first block.
 *
 * mp_plan() plans all blocks between and including the (effective)
 * first block and the bl.  It sets entry, exit and cruise v's from vmax's then
 * calls trapezoid generation.
 *
 * Variables that must be provided in the mp_buffer_t that will be processed:
 *
 *   bl (function arg)     - end of block list (last block in time)
 *   bl->replannable       - start of block list set by last FALSE value
 *                           [Note 1]
 *   bl->move_type         - typically MOVE_TYPE_ALINE. Other move_types should
 *                           be set to length=0, entry_vmax=0 and exit_vmax=0
 *                           and are treated as a momentary stop (plan to zero
 *                           and from zero).
 *   bl->length            - provides block length
 *   bl->entry_vmax        - used during forward planning to set entry velocity
 *   bl->cruise_vmax       - used during forward planning to set cruise velocity
 *   bl->exit_vmax         - used during forward planning to set exit velocity
 *   bl->delta_vmax        - used during forward planning to set exit velocity
 *   bl->cbrt_jerk         - used during trapezoid generation
 *
 * Variables that will be set during processing:
 *
 *   bl->replannable       - set if the block becomes optimally planned
 *   bl->braking_velocity  - set during backward planning
 *   bl->entry_velocity    - set during forward planning
 *   bl->cruise_velocity   - set during forward planning
 *   bl->exit_velocity     - set during forward planning
 *   bl->head_length       - set during trapezoid generation
 *   bl->body_length       - set during trapezoid generation
 *   bl->tail_length       - set during trapezoid generation
 *
 * Variables that are ignored but here's what you would expect them to be:
 *
 *   bl->state             - BUFFER_NEW for all blocks but the earliest
 *   bl->target[]          - block target position
 *   bl->unit[]            - block unit vector
 *   bl->jerk              - source of the other jerk variables.
 *
 * Notes:
 *
 * [1] Whether or not a block is planned is controlled by the bl->replannable
 *     setting.  Replan flags are checked during the backwards pass.  They prune
 *     the replan list to include only the latest blocks that require planning.
 *
 *     In normal operation, the first block (currently running block) is not
 *     replanned, but may be for feedholds and feed overrides.  In these cases,
 *     the prep routines modify the contents of the (ex) buffer and re-shuffle
 *     the block list, re-enlisting the current bl buffer with new parameters.
 *     These routines also set all blocks in the list to be replannable so the
 *     list can be recomputed regardless of exact stops and previous replanning
 *     optimizations.

/*** Derive accel/decel length from delta V and jerk
 *
 * A convenient function for determining the optimal_length (L) of a line
 * given the initial velocity (Vi), final velocity (Vf) and maximum jerk (Jm).
 *
 * Definitions:
 *
 *   Jm = the given maximum jerk
 *   T  = time of the entire move
 *   Vi = initial velocity
 *   Vf = final velocity
 *   T  = time
 *   As = accel at inflection point between convex & concave portions of S-curve
 *   Ar = ramp acceleration
 *
 * Formulas:
 *
 *   T  = 2 * sqrt((Vt - Vi) / Jm)
 *   As = (Jm * T) / 2
 *   Ar = As / 2 = (Jm * T) / 4
 *
 * Then the length (distance) equation is:
 *
 *    a)  L = (Vf - Vi) * T - (Ar * T^2) / 2
 *
 * Substituting for Ar and T:
 *
 *    b)  L = (Vf - Vi) * 2 * sqrt((Vf - Vi) / Jm) -
 *            (2 * sqrt((Vf - Vi) / Jm) * (Vf - Vi)) / 2
 *
 * Reducing b).  See Wolfram Alpha:
 *
 *    c)  L = (Vf - Vi)^(3/2) / sqrt(Jm)
 *
 * Assuming Vf >= Vi [Note 2]:
 *
 *    d)  L = (Vf - Vi) * sqrt((Vf - Vi) / Jm)
 *
 * Notes:
 *
 * [1] Assuming Vi, Vf and L are positive or zero.
 * [2] Cannot assume Vf >= Vi due to rounding errors and use of

/*** Derive velocity achievable from delta V and length
 *
 * A convenient function for determining Vf target velocity for a given
 * initial velocity (Vi), length (L), and maximum jerk (Jm).  Equation e) is
 * b) solved for Vf.  Equation f) is c) solved for Vf.  Use f) (obviously)
 *
 *   e)  Vf = (sqrt(L) * (L / sqrt(1 / Jm))^(1/6) +
 *            (1 / Jm)^(1/4) * Vi) / (1 / Jm)^(1/4)
 *
 *   f)  Vf = L^(2/3) * Jm^(1/3) + Vi
 *
 * FYI: Here's an expression that returns the jerk for a given deltaV and L:
 *
 *   cube(deltaV / (pow(L, 0.66666666)));
 *
 * We do some Newton-Raphson iterations to narrow it down.
 * We need a formula that includes known variables except the one we want to
 * find, and has a root [Z(x) = 0] at the value (x) we are looking for.
 *
 *   Z(x) = zero at x
 *
 * We calculate the value from the knowns and the estimate (see below) and then
 * subtract the known value to get zero (root) if x is the correct value.
 *
 *   Vi = initial velocity (known)
 *   Vf = estimated final velocity
 *   J  = jerk (known)
 *   L  = length (know)
 *
 * There are (at least) two such functions we can use:
 *
 * L from J, Vi, and Vf:
 *
 *   L = sqrt((Vf - Vi) / J) * (Vi + Vf)
 *
 * Replacing Vf with x, and subtracting the known L we get:
 *
 *   0 = sqrt((x - Vi) / J) * (Vi + x) - L
 *   Z(x) = sqrt((x - Vi) / J) * (Vi + x) - L
 *
 * Or J from L, Vi, and Vf:
 *
 *   J = ((Vf - Vi) * (Vi + Vf)^2) / L^2
 *
 * Replacing Vf with x, and subtracting the known J we get:
 *
 *   0 = ((x - Vi) * (Vi + x)^2) / L^2 - J
 *   Z(x) = ((x - Vi) * (Vi + x)^2) / L^2 - J
 *
 * L doesn't resolve to the value very quickly (its graph is nearly vertical).
 * So, we'll use J, which resolves in < 10 iterations, often in only two or
 * three with a good estimate.
 *
 * In order to do a Newton-Raphson iteration, we need the derivative. Here
 * they are for both the (unused) L and the (used) J formulas above:
 *
 *   J > 0, Vi > 0, Vf > 0
 *   A = sqrt((x - Vi) * J)
 *   B = sqrt((x - Vi) / J)
 *
 *   L'(x) = B + (Vi + x) / (2 * J) + (Vi + x) / (2 * A)
 *
 *   J'(x) = (2 * Vi * x - Vi^2 + 3 * x^2) / L^2
