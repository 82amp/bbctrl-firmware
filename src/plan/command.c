/* How this works:
 *   - The command is called by the Gcode interpreter (cm_<command>, e.g. an M
 *     code)
 *   - cm_ function calls mp_queue_command which puts it in the planning queue
 *     (bf buffer).
 *     This involves setting some parameters and registering a callback to the
 *     execution function in the canonical machine
 *   - the planning queue gets to the function and calls _exec_command()
 *   - ...which puts a pointer to the bf buffer in the prep struct (st_pre)
 *   - When the runtime gets to the end of the current activity (sending steps,
 *     counting a dwell)
 *     if executes mp_runtime_command...
 *   - ...which uses the callback function in the bf and the saved parameters in
 *     the vectors
 *   - To finish up mp_runtime_command() needs to free the bf buffer
 *
 * Doing it this way instead of synchronizing on queue empty simplifies the
 * handling of feedholds, feed overrides, buffer flushes, and thread blocking,
 * and makes keeping the queue full much easier - therefore avoiding starvation
