  This is generally all you need to import.

  On instantiation, we open all devices that are keyboards, mice or joysticks.
  That means we might have two of one sort of another, and that might be a
  problem, but it would be rather rare.

  There are several ABS (joystick, touch) events that we do not handle,
  specifically THROTTLE, RUDDER, WHEEL, GAS, BRAKE, HAT1, HAT2, HAT3, PRESSURE,
  DISTANCE, TILT, TOOL_WIDTH. Implementing these is left as an exercise
  for the interested reader. Similarly, we make no attempt to handle
  multi-touch.

  Handlers can be supplied, in which case they are called for each event, but
  it isn't necessary; API exists for all the events.

  The handler signature is:

    def handler_func(event, state)

  where:
    event:
      An Event object describing the event.

    state:
      An EventState object describing the current state.

  Use key_to_code() to convert from the name of a key to its code,
  and code_to_key() to convert a code to a name.

  The keys are listed in inevent.Constants.py or /usr/include/linux/input.h
  Note that the key names refer to a US keyboard.
