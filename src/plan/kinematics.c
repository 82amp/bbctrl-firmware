/* Wrapper routine for inverse kinematics
 *
 * Calls kinematics function(s).  Performs axis mapping & conversion
 * of length units to steps (and deals with inhibited axes)
 *
 * The reason steps are returned as floats (as opposed to, say,
 * uint32_t) is to accommodate fractional DDA steps. The DDA deals
 * with fractional step values as fixed-point binary in order to get
 * the smoothest possible operation. Steps are passed to the move prep
 * routine as floats and converted to fixed-point binary during queue
 * loading. See stepper.c for details.
