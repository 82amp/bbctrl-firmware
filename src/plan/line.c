/* Sonny's algorithm - simple
 *
 * Computes the maximum allowable junction speed by finding the
 * velocity that will yield the centripetal acceleration in the
 * corner_acceleration value. The value of delta sets the effective
 * radius of curvature. Here's Sonny's (Sungeun K. Jeon's)
 * explanation of what's going on:
 *
 * "First let's assume that at a junction we only look a centripetal
 * acceleration to simply things. At a junction of two lines, let's
 * place a circle such that both lines are tangent to the circle. The
 * circular segment joining the lines represents the path for
 * constant centripetal acceleration. This creates a deviation from
 * the path (let's call this delta), which is the distance from the
 * junction to the edge of the circular segment. Delta needs to be
 * defined, so let's replace the term max_jerk (see note 1) with
 * max_junction_deviation, or "delta". This indirectly sets the
 * radius of the circle, and hence limits the velocity by the
 * centripetal acceleration. Think of the this as widening the race
 * track. If a race car is driving on a track only as wide as a car,
 * it'll have to slow down a lot to turn corners. If we widen the
 * track a bit, the car can start to use the track to go into the
 * turn. The wider it is, the faster through the corner it can go.
 *
 * (Note 1: "max_jerk" refers to the old grbl/marlin max_jerk"
 * approximation term, not the TinyG jerk terms)
 *
 * If you do the geometry in terms of the known variables, you get:
 *     sin(theta/2) = R/(R+delta)
 * Re-arranging in terms of circle radius (R)
 *     R = delta*sin(theta/2)/(1-sin(theta/2).
 *
 * Theta is the angle between line segments given by:
 *     cos(theta) = dot(a,b)/(norm(a)*norm(b)).
 *
 * Most of these calculations are already done in the planner.
 * To remove the acos() and sin() computations, use the trig half
 * angle identity:
 *     sin(theta/2) = +/- sqrt((1-cos(theta))/2).
 *
 * For our applications, this should always be positive. Now just
 * plug the equations into the centripetal acceleration equation:
 * v_c = sqrt(a_max*R). You'll see that there are only two sqrt
 * computations and no sine/cosines."
 *
 * How to compute the radius using brute-force trig:
 *    float theta = acos(costheta);
 *    float radius = delta * sin(theta/2)/(1-sin(theta/2));
 *
 * This version extends Chamnit's algorithm by computing a value for
 * delta that takes the contributions of the individual axes in the
 * move into account. This allows the control radius to vary by
 * axis. This is necessary to support axes that have different
 * dynamics; such as a Z axis that doesn't move as fast as X and Y
 * (such as a screw driven Z axis on machine with a belt driven XY -
 * like a Shapeoko), or rotary axes ABC that have completely
 * different dynamics than their linear counterparts.
 *
 * The function takes the absolute values of the sum of the unit
 * vector components as a measure of contribution to the move, then
 * scales the delta values from the non-zero axes into a composite
 * delta to be used for the move. Shown for an XY vector:
 *
 *     U[i]    Unit sum of i'th axis    fabs(unit_a[i]) + fabs(unit_b[i])
 *     Usum    Length of sums           Ux + Uy
 *     d       Delta of sums            (Dx*Ux+DY*UY)/Usum

/* Plan a line with acceleration / deceleration
 *
 * This function uses constant jerk motion equations to plan
 * acceleration and deceleration. Jerk is the rate of change of
 * acceleration; it's the 1st derivative of acceleration, and the
 * 3rd derivative of position. Jerk is a measure of impact to the
 * machine.  Controlling jerk smooths transitions between moves and
 * allows for faster feeds while controlling machine oscillations
 * and other undesirable side-effects.
 *
 * Note All math is done in absolute coordinates using single
 * precision floating point (float).
 *
 * Note: Returning a status that is not STAT_OK means the endpoint
 * is NOT advanced. So lines that are too short to move will
 * accumulate and get executed once the accumulated error exceeds
 * the minimums.

  // want to find the axis for which the jerk cannot be exceeded - the
  // 'jerk-limit' axis. This is the axis for which the time to
  // decelerate from the target velocity to zero would be the longest.
  //
  // We can determine the "longest" deceleration in terms of time or distance.
  //
  // The math for time-to-decelerate T from speed S to speed E with constant
  // jerk J is:
  //
  //   T = 2 * sqrt((S - E) / J)
  //
  // Since E is always zero in this calculation, we can simplify:
  //
  //   T = 2 * sqrt(S / J)
  //
  // The math for distance-to-decelerate l from speed S to speed E with
  // constant jerk J is:
  //
  //   l = (S + E) * sqrt((S - E) / J)
  //
  // Since E is always zero in this calculation, we can simplify:
  //
  //   l = S * sqrt(S / J)
  //
  // The final value we want to know is which one is *longest*,
  // compared to the others, so we don't need the actual value. This
  // means that the scale of the value doesn't matter, so for T we
  // can remove the "2 *" and For L we can remove the "S*".  This
  // leaves both to be simply "sqrt(S/J)". Since we don't need the
  // scale, it doesn't matter what speed we're coming from, so S can
  // be replaced with 1.
  //
  // However, we *do* need to compensate for the fact that each axis
  // contributes differently to the move, so we will scale each
  // contribution C[n] by the proportion of the axis movement length
  // D[n] to the total length of the move L.  Using that, we
  // construct the following, with these definitions:
  //
  //   J[n] = max_jerk for axis n
  //   D[n] = distance traveled for this move for axis n
  //   L = total length of the move in all axes
  //   C[n] = "axis contribution" of axis n
  //
  // For each axis n:
  //
  //   C[n] = sqrt(1 / J[n]) * (D[n] / L)
  //
  // Keeping in mind that we only need a rank compared to the other
  // axes, we can further optimize the calculations:
  //
  // Square the expression to remove the square root:
  //
  //   C[n]^2 = (1 / J[n]) * (D[n] / L)^2
  //
  // We don't care the C is squared, so we'll use it that way.
  //
  // Re-arranged to optimize divides for pre-calculated values,
  // we create a value M that we compute once:
  //
  //   M = 1 / L^2
  //
  // Then we use it in the calculations for every axis:
  //
  //   C[n] = 1 / J[n] * D[n]^2 * M
  //
  // Also note that we already have 1 / J[n] calculated for each axis,
  // which simplifies it further.
  //
  // Finally, the selected jerk term needs to be scaled by the
  // reciprocal of the absolute value of the jerk-limit axis's unit
  // vector term. This way when the move is finally decomposed into
  // its constituent axes for execution the jerk for that axis will be
  // at it's maximum value.
