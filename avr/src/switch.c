/* Normally open switches (NO) trigger an interrupt on the
 * falling edge and lockout subsequent interrupts for the defined
 * lockout period. This approach beats doing debouncing as an
 * integration as switches fire immediately.
 *
 * Normally closed switches (NC) trigger an interrupt on the
 * rising edge and lockout subsequent interrupts for the defined
 * lockout period.
 *
 * These functions interact with each other to process switch closures
 * and firing.  Each switch has a counter which is initially set to
 * negative SW_DEGLITCH_TICKS.  When a switch closure is DETECTED the
 * count increments for each RTC tick.  When the count reaches zero
 * the switch is tripped and action occurs.  The counter continues to
 * increment positive until the lockout is exceeded.
