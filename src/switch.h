/* Switch processing functions
 *
 * Switch processing turns pin transitions into reliable switch states.
 * There are 2 main operations:
 *
 *   - read pin        get raw data from a pin
 *   - read switch        return processed switch closures
 *
 * Read pin may be a polled operation or an interrupt on pin
 * change. If interrupts are used they must be provided for both
 * leading and trailing edge transitions.
 *
 * Read switch contains the results of read pin and manages edges and
 * debouncing.
