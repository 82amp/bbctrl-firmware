/* Sonny's algorithm - simple
 *
 * Computes the maximum allowable junction speed by finding the velocity that
 * will yield the centripetal acceleration in the corner_acceleration value. The
 * value of delta sets the effective radius of curvature. Here's Sonny's
 * (Sungeun K. Jeon's) explanation of what's going on:
 *
 * "First let's assume that at a junction we only look a centripetal
 * acceleration to simply things. At a junction of two lines, let's place a
 * circle such that both lines are tangent to the circle. The circular segment
 * joining the lines represents the path for constant centripetal
 * acceleration. This creates a deviation from the path (let's call this delta),
 * which is the distance from the junction to the edge of the circular
 * segment. Delta needs to be defined, so let's replace the term max_jerk (see
 * note 1) with max_junction_deviation, or "delta". This indirectly sets the
 * radius of the circle, and hence limits the velocity by the centripetal
 * acceleration. Think of the this as widening the race track. If a race car is
 * driving on a track only as wide as a car, it'll have to slow down a lot to
 * turn corners. If we widen the track a bit, the car can start to use the track
 * to go into the turn. The wider it is, the faster through the corner it can
 * go.
 *
 * (Note 1: "max_jerk" refers to the old grbl/marlin max_jerk" approximation
 * term, not the TinyG jerk terms)
 *
 * If you do the geometry in terms of the known variables, you get:
 *
 *     sin(theta/2) = R / (R + delta)
 *
 * Re-arranging in terms of circle radius (R)
 *
 *     R = delta * sin(theta/2) / (1 - sin(theta/2))
 *
 * Theta is the angle between line segments given by:
 *
 *     cos(theta) = dot(a, b) / (norm(a) * norm(b)).
 *
 * Most of these calculations are already done in the planner.
 * To remove the acos() and sin() computations, use the trig half
 * angle identity:
 *
 *     sin(theta/2) = +/-sqrt((1 - cos(theta)) / 2)
 *
 * For our applications, this should always be positive. Now just plug the
 * equations into the centripetal acceleration equation: v_c =
 * sqrt(a_max*R). You'll see that there are only two sqrt computations and no
 * sine/cosines."
 *
 * How to compute the radius using brute-force trig:
 *
 *    float theta = acos(costheta);
 *    float radius = delta * sin(theta/2) / (1 - sin(theta/2));
 *
 * This version extends Chamnit's algorithm by computing a value for delta that
 * takes the contributions of the individual axes in the move into account. This
 * allows the control radius to vary by axis. This is necessary to support axes
 * that have different dynamics; such as a Z axis that doesn't move as fast as X
 * and Y (such as a screw driven Z axis on machine with a belt driven XY - like
 * a Shapeoko), or rotary axes ABC that have completely different dynamics than
 * their linear counterparts.
 *
 * The function takes the absolute values of the sum of the unit vector
 * components as a measure of contribution to the move, then scales the delta
 * values from the non-zero axes into a composite delta to be used for the
 * move. Shown for an XY vector:
 *
 *     U[i]    Unit sum of i'th axis    fabs(unit_a[i]) + fabs(unit_b[i])
 *     Usum    Length of sums           Ux + Uy
 *     d       Delta of sums            (Dx * Ux + DY * UY) / Usum

  /* Determine jerk value to use for the block.  First find the axis for which
   * the jerk cannot be exceeded - the 'jerk_axis'.  This is the axis for which
   * the time to decelerate from the target velocity to zero would be the
   * longest.
   *
   * We can determine the "longest" deceleration in terms of time or distance.
   *
   * The math for time-to-decelerate T from speed S to speed E with constant
   * jerk J is:
   *
   *   T = 2 * sqrt((S - E) / J)
   *
   * Since E is always zero in this calculation, we can simplify:
   *
   *   T = 2 * sqrt(S / J)
   *
   * The math for distance-to-decelerate l from speed S to speed E with
   * constant jerk J is:
   *
   *   l = (S + E) * sqrt((S - E) / J)
   *
   * Since E is always zero in this calculation, we can simplify:
   *
   *   l = S * sqrt(S / J)
   *
   * The final value we want to know is which one is *longest*, compared to the
   * others, so we don't need the actual value.  This means that the scale of
   * the value doesn't matter, so for T we can remove the "2 *" and for L we can
   * remove the "S *".  This leaves both to be simply "sqrt(S / J)".  Since we
   * don't need the scale, it doesn't matter what speed we're coming from, so S
   * can be replaced with 1.
   *
   * However, we *do* need to compensate for the fact that each axis contributes
   * differently to the move, so we will scale each contribution C[n] by the
   * proportion of the axis movement length D[n].  Using that, we construct the
   * following, with these definitions:
   *
   *   J[n] = max_jerk for axis n
   *   D[n] = distance traveled for this move for axis n
   *   C[n] = "axis contribution" of axis n
   *
   * For each axis n:
   *
   *   C[n] = sqrt(1 / J[n]) * D[n]
   *
   * Keeping in mind that we only need a rank compared to the other axes, we can
   * further optimize the calculations:
   *
   * Square the expression to remove the square root:
   *
   *   C[n]^2 = 1 / J[n] * D[n]^2
   *
   * We don't care that C is squared, so we'll use it that way.  Also note that
   * we already have 1 / J[n] calculated for each axis.
