/* Planner Notes
 *
 * The planner works below the canonical machine and above the
 * motor mapping and stepper execution layers. A rudimentary
 * multitasking capability is implemented for long-running commands
 * such as lines, arcs, and dwells.  These functions are coded as
 * non-blocking continuations - which are simple state machines
 * that are re-entered multiple times until a particular operation
 * is complete. These functions have 2 parts - the initial call,
 * which sets up the local context, and callbacks (continuations)
 * that are called from the main loop (in controller.c).
 *
 * One important concept is isolation of the three layers of the
 * data model - the Gcode model (gm), planner model (bf queue &
 * mm), and runtime model (mr).  These are designated as "model",
 * "planner" and "runtime" in function names.
 *
 * The Gcode model is owned by the canonical machine and should
 * only be accessed by cm_xxxx() functions. Data from the Gcode
 * model is transferred to the planner by the mp_xxx() functions
 * called by the canonical machine.
 *
 * The planner should only use data in the planner model. When a
 * move (block) is ready for execution the planner data is
 * transferred to the runtime model, which should also be isolated.
 *
 * Lower-level models should never use data from upper-level models
 * as the data may have changed and lead to unpredictable results.

/* Since steps are in motor space you have to run the position vector
 * through inverse kinematics to get the right numbers. This means
 * that in a non-Cartesian robot changing any position can result in
 * changes to multiple step values. So this operation is provided as a
 * single function and always uses the new position vector as an
 * input.
 *
 * Keeping track of position is complicated by the fact that moves
 * exist in several reference frames. The scheme to keep this
 * straight is:
 *
 *   - mm.position    - start and end position for planning
 *   - mr.position    - current position of runtime segment
 *   - mr.target      - target position of runtime segment
 *   - mr.endpoint    - final target position of runtime segment
 *
 * Note that position is set immediately when called and may not be
 * not an accurate representation of the tool position. The motors
 * are still processing the action and the real tool position is
 * still close to the starting point.
