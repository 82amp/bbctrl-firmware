C!
=====

The C! or cbang library is a collection of C++ utility libraries developed over the course of +10 years and several major C++ application development projects.  It should compile and run on Windows, Linux and OSX using a modern C++ compiler.

Many of the facilities of C! are geared towards cross-platform application development and providing basic services that most applications need such as a configuration system, run-time build information, logging facilities, threads, smart pointers, simple embedded scripting, etc.

C!'s philosophy is to create clean, simple, readable, modular and reusable code.  C! also encourages exception based error handling, and light use of C++ templates and C preprocesor macros.

C! "leans" on the venerable boost library but also reimplements several boost APIs which are considered by the author to be too template heavy, less readable or overly complicated in boost.

The code was developed on an as needed basis and was never intended to be any sort of grand unifying system for C++ application development.  However, I hope you find many parts of the library useful in your C++
development projects.

# Prerequisites
## General
  - A modern C++ compiler: GNU C++, Intel C++, MSVS
  - SCons    http://scons.org/
  - bzip2    http://bzip.org/
  - zlib     http://zlib.net/
  - expat    http://expat.sourceforge.net/
  - openssl  http://www.openssl.org/
  - sqlite   http://www.sqlite.org/
  - boost    http://www.boost.org/

## Windows only
  - Winsock

## OS-X only
  - IOKit
  - CoreFoundation

## POSIX/Linux only
  - pthreads
  - libbfd (For debug mode only)

On Debian based systems the prerequisites can be installed with the following
command line:

    sudo apt-get install scons build-essential libbz2-dev zlib1g-dev \
      libexpat1-dev libssl-dev libboost-dev libsqlite3-dev subversion

# Build

    cd cbang
    scons

There are a number of build options which can either be passed on the command line to scons or place in a configuration file named 'options.py'.  These options are as follows:

  - debug                - Enable debugging
  - optimize             - Enable compiler optimizations
  - static               - Build a static library
  - shared               - Build a shared library
  - strict               - Enable strict checking
  - distcc               - Enable distcc distributed compile system
  - ccache               - Enable ccache caching compile system
  - backtrace_debugger   - Enable the printing backtraces

These options are enabled by setting them to 1.  For example:

    scons debug=1
