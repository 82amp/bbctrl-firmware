/* Main loop - top-level controller
 *
 * The order of the dispatched tasks is very important.
 * Tasks are ordered by increasing dependency (blocking hierarchy).
 * Tasks that are dependent on completion of lower-level tasks must be
 * later in the list than the task(s) they are dependent upon.
 *
 * Tasks must be written as continuations as they will be called repeatedly,
 * and are called even if they are not currently active.
 *
 * The DISPATCH macro calls the function and returns to the controller parent
 * if not finished (STAT_EAGAIN), preventing later routines from running
 * (they remain blocked). Any other condition - OK or ERR - drops through
 * and runs the next routine in the list.
 *
 * A routine that had no action (i.e. is OFF or idle) should return STAT_NOOP
