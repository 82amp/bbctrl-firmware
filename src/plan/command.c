/* How this works:
 *   - A command is called by the Gcode interpreter (mach_<command>,
 *     e.g. M code)
 *   - mach_ function calls mp_command_queue which puts it in the planning queue
 *     (bf buffer) which sets some parameters and registers a callback to the
 *     execution function in the machine.
 *   - When the planning queue gets to the function it calls _exec_command()
 *     which loads a pointer to the function and its args in stepper.c's next
 *     move.
 *   - When the runtime gets to the end of the current activity (sending steps,
 *     counting a dwell) it executes the callback function passing the args.
 *
 * Doing it this way instead of synchronizing on queue empty simplifies the
 * handling of feedholds, feed overrides, buffer flushes, and thread blocking,
 * and makes keeping the queue full and avoiding starvation much easier.
