/*
  Device singleton - global structure to allow iteration through similar devices

  Ports are shared between steppers and GPIO so we need a global struct.
  Each xmega port has 3 bindings; motors, switches and the output bit

  Care needs to be taken in routines that use ports not to write to bits that
  are not assigned to the designated function - ur unpredicatable results will
  occur.
