/* Feedhold is executed as cm.hold_state transitions executed inside
 * _exec_aline() and main loop callbacks to these functions:
 * mp_plan_hold_callback() and mp_end_hold().
 *
 * Holds work like this:
 *
 * - Hold is asserted by calling cm_feedhold() (usually invoked via a
 *   ! char) If hold_state is OFF and motion_state is RUNning it sets
 *   hold_state to SYNC and motion_state to HOLD.
 *
 * - Hold state == SYNC tells the aline exec routine to execute the
 *   next aline segment then set hold_state to PLAN. This gives the
 *   planner sufficient time to replan the block list for the hold
 *   before the next aline segment needs to be processed.
 *
 * - Hold state == PLAN tells the planner to replan the mr buffer, the
 *   current run buffer (bf), and any subsequent bf buffers as
 *   necessary to execute a hold. Hold planning replans the planner
 *   buffer queue down to zero and then back up from zero. Hold state
 *   is set to DECEL when planning is complete.
 *
 * - Hold state == DECEL persists until the aline execution runs to
 *   zero velocity, at which point hold state transitions to HOLD.
 *
 * - Hold state == HOLD persists until the cycle is restarted. A cycle
 *   start is an asynchronous event that sets the cycle_start_flag
 *   TRUE. It can occur any time after the hold is requested - either
 *   before or after motion stops.
 *
 * - mp_end_hold() is executed from cm_feedhold_sequencing_callback()
 *   once the hold state == HOLD and a cycle_start has been
 *   requested.This sets the hold state to OFF which enables
 *   _exec_aline() to continue processing. Move execution begins with
 *   the first buffer after the hold.
 *
 * Terms used:
 *  - mr is the runtime buffer. It was initially loaded from the bf
 *    buffer
 *  - bp+0 is the "companion" bf buffer to the mr buffer.
 *  - bp+1 is the bf buffer following bp+0. This runs through bp+N
 *  - bp (by itself) just refers to the current buffer being
 *    adjusted / replanned
 *
 * Details: Planning re-uses bp+0 as an "extra" buffer. Normally bp+0
 *   is returned to the buffer pool as it is redundant once mr is
 *   loaded. Use the extra buffer to split the move in two where the
 *   hold decelerates to zero. Use one buffer to go to zero, the other
 *   to replan up from zero. All buffers past that point are
 *   unaffected other than that they need to be replanned for
 *   velocity.
 *
 * Note: There are multiple opportunities for more efficient
 *   organization of code in this module, but the code is so
 *   complicated I just left it organized for clarity and hoped for
 *   the best from compiler optimization.
